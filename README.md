# Huffman-Codes
The project consists of four main modules: 
Huffman Dictionary function which assigns a codeword to each source symbol using the huffman algorithm.
Huffman Encoder Function which uses the huffman dictionary to encode a binary stream.
Huffman Decoder Function which uses the huffman dictionary to decode a huffman encoded binary stream.
Huffman Tree Visualization Function which uses the huffman dictionary to construct the Huffman Binary Tree. 
Note: Detailed description of the implementation can be found in the project report.
